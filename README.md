Credits
=======

This plugin implementation was inspired by :

- [tpope/vim-obsession] (https://github.com/tpope/vim-obsession)

    Helped me better understand how to correctly manage sessions.

- [Manual-colmenero/vim-simple-session] (https://github.com/Manuel-colmenero/vim-simple-session)

    This plugin was the initiator. I was a user and liked the idea. But it was
    buggy. I tried to debug it but the process of creating a new plugin was too
    appealing.
