vim-ctrlp-session
=================

CtrlP extension to manage *Vim* sessions.

Features
========

Improve *Vim* session experience:

    - Fuzzy search sessions
    - Create sessions tracking Git branches
    - One configurable location for all session files.
    - Fast context switching

Most useful when working within gVim (or MacVim) or on platforms where session
switching tools (ex: TMux) are not common place (Windows...ahem...).

    - [CtrlP](https://github.com/kien/ctrlp)
